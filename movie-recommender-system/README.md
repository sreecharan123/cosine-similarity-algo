# Movie-Recommendation-System 

A Machine Learning Project Movie Recommendation system using React and Flask.

In this Web application i used React for Front-end and Flask for Back-end.

For Movie-Recommendation i have used Machine Learning model which is trained over tmdb 5000 Movie dataset and provide the Recommendation

I used COSINE SIMILARITY algorithm to get similarity when user chooses a movie .


## Features 


1.User can Search Movie

2.User can watch trailer and some clips of the Movie

3.If a user watched a clips of a movie then the movie details will stored in localstorage and based on the movie name the user will see the recommendation on the home screen

4.If a user type a text in Searchbar then it will auto complete.
